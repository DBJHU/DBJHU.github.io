## Analysis with SQL

The [OMOP Query Library](https://data.ohdsi.org/QueryLibrary/) is a library of commonly-used SQL queries for the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).


## Analysis with R
Below are some sample R queries that demonstrate how to read in OMOP tables from CSV files, join them based on the `person_id` and `visit_occurrence_id` fields, and search for specific criteria.

Note: Adjust the file paths and column names accordingly based on the actual structure and location of your CSV files. The queries below are a generic representation and may need adjustments based on the specifics of your data set.

### Reading CSV files into R data frames:

```R
# Read the CSV files into R data frames
person_df <- read.csv("path_to_person_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
visit_occurrence_df <- read.csv("path_to_visit_occurrence_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
condition_occurrence_df <- read.csv("path_to_condition_occurrence_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```
Join tables based on `person_id`:

When a person has multiple visits in the `visit_occurrence` table, joining the `person` table with the `visit_occurrence` table will result in multiple rows for that person, each corresponding to a different visit. This is a standard one-to-many join operation.

```R
## Join person with visit_occurrence on 'person_id'
person_visit_df <- merge(person_df, visit_occurrence_df, by="person_id")
```

### Joining the Person-Visit table with the Condition Occurrence table:

```R
# Join the person-visit result with condition_occurrence on both 'person_id' and 'visit_occurrence_id'
full_df <- merge(person_visit_df, condition_occurrence_df, by=c("person_id", "visit_occurrence_id"))
```

### Search by a list of `person_ids`:

```R
# Define a list of person_ids to search for
search_person_ids <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Filter the data frame to only include rows with person_ids in the list
filtered_by_person_df <- subset(full_df, person_id %in% search_person_ids)
```

### Search by a specific condition concept code:

```R
# Define a specific condition concept code to search for
search_condition_concept_id <- 1234567

# Filter the data frame to only include rows with the specified condition concept code
filtered_by_condition_df <- subset(full_df, condition_concept_id == search_condition_concept_id)
```

### Search by a date range:

```R
# Define a date range to search for
start_date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2020-12-31")

## Filter the data frame to only include rows within the date range
filtered_by_date_df <- subset(full_df, visit_start_date >= start_date & visit_start_date <= end_date)
```
<!--TBD
## Analysis with Python 

### Required Python Libraries:

To execute the Python queries, you'll need to install the pandas library. -->
