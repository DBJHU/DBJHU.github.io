# Commonly Used CDM Tables Overview
The OMOP common data model (CDM) is a relational database made up of different tables that relate to each other by foreign keys (XXXX_ID values; e.g., PERSON_ID or PROVIDER_ID). The OMOP tables in your data export are as follows:

| Table              | Description |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Person             | Contains basic demographic information describing a participant, including biological sex, birth date, race, and ethnicity. |
| Visit_occurrence   | Captures encounters with healthcare providers or similar events. Contains the type of visit a person has (outpatient care, inpatient care, or long-term care), as well as the date and duration information. Rows in other tables can reference this table, for example, condition_occurrences related to a specific visit. |
| Condition_occurrence | Indicates the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or symptom, which is either observed by a provider or reported by the patient. |
| Drug_exposure      | Captures records about the utilization of a medication. Drug exposures include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as drugs. Drug exposure is inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensing, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information. |
| Measurement        | Contains both orders and results of a systematic and standardized examination or testing of a participant or participant's sample, including laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. |
| Procedure_occurrence | Contains records of activities or processes ordered by or carried out by a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. |
| Observation        | Captures clinical facts about a person obtained in the context of an examination, questioning, or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by another domain, such as social and lifestyle facts, medical history, and family history, are recorded here. |
| Device_exposure    | Captures information about a person's exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Devices include implantable objects, blood transfusions, medical equipment and supplies, other instruments used in medical procedures, and material used in clinical care. |
| Death              | Contains the clinical events surrounding how and when a participant dies. |

## Analysis with SQL

The [OMOP Query Library](https://data.ohdsi.org/QueryLibrary/) is a library of commonly-used SQL queries for the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).


## Analysis with R
Below are some sample R queries that demonstrate how to read in OMOP tables from CSV files, join them based on the `person_id` and `visit_occurrence_id` fields, and search for specific criteria.

Note: Adjust the file paths and column names accordingly based on the actual structure and location of your CSV files. The queries below are a generic representation and may need adjustments based on the specifics of your data set.

### Reading CSV files into R data frames:

```R
# Read the CSV files into R data frames
person_df <- read.csv("path_to_person_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
visit_occurrence_df <- read.csv("path_to_visit_occurrence_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
condition_occurrence_df <- read.csv("path_to_condition_occurrence_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```
Join tables based on `person_id`:

When a person has multiple visits in the `visit_occurrence` table, joining the `person` table with the `visit_occurrence` table will result in multiple rows for that person, each corresponding to a different visit. This is a standard one-to-many join operation.

```R
## Join person with visit_occurrence on 'person_id'
person_visit_df <- merge(person_df, visit_occurrence_df, by="person_id")
```

### Joining the Person-Visit table with the Condition Occurrence table:

```R
# Join the person-visit result with condition_occurrence on both 'person_id' and 'visit_occurrence_id'
full_df <- merge(person_visit_df, condition_occurrence_df, by=c("person_id", "visit_occurrence_id"))
```

### Search by a list of `person_ids`:

```R
# Define a list of person_ids to search for
search_person_ids <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Filter the data frame to only include rows with person_ids in the list
filtered_by_person_df <- subset(full_df, person_id %in% search_person_ids)
```

### Search by a specific condition concept code:

```R
# Define a specific condition concept code to search for
search_condition_concept_id <- 1234567

# Filter the data frame to only include rows with the specified condition concept code
filtered_by_condition_df <- subset(full_df, condition_concept_id == search_condition_concept_id)
```

### Search by a date range:

```R
# Define a date range to search for
start_date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2020-12-31")

## Filter the data frame to only include rows within the date range
filtered_by_date_df <- subset(full_df, visit_start_date >= start_date & visit_start_date <= end_date)
```
<!--TBD
## Analysis with Python 

### Required Python Libraries:

To execute the Python queries, you'll need to install the pandas library. -->
