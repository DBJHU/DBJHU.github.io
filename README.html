<h1>Commonly Used CDM Tables Overview</h1>
<p>The OMOP common data model (CDM) is a relational database made up of different tables that relate to each other by foreign keys (XXXX_ID values; e.g., PERSON_ID or PROVIDER_ID). The OMOP tables in your data export are as follows:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 48%">
<col style="width: 51%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Table</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Person</td>
<td>Contains basic demographic information describing a participant, including biological sex, birth date, race, and ethnicity.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Visit_occurrence</td>
<td>Captures encounters with healthcare providers or similar events. Contains the type of visit a person has (outpatient care, inpatient care, or long-term care), as well as the date and duration information. Rows in other tables can reference this table, for example, condition_occurrences related to a specific visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Condition_occurrence</td>
<td>Indicates the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or symptom, which is either observed by a provider or reported by the patient.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Drug_exposure</td>
<td>Captures records about the utilization of a medication. Drug exposures include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as drugs. Drug exposure is inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensing, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Measurement</td>
<td>Contains both orders and results of a systematic and standardized examination or testing of a participant or participant’s sample, including laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Procedure_occurrence</td>
<td>Contains records of activities or processes ordered by or carried out by a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Observation</td>
<td>Captures clinical facts about a person obtained in the context of an examination, questioning, or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by another domain, such as social and lifestyle facts, medical history, and family history, are recorded here.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Device_exposure</td>
<td>Captures information about a person’s exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Devices include implantable objects, blood transfusions, medical equipment and supplies, other instruments used in medical procedures, and material used in clinical care.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Death</td>
<td>Contains the clinical events surrounding how and when a participant dies.</td>

<h1>Analysis Tools</h1>
<p>R, SQL, Python, or any preferred data analysis software. Examples provided below are for R and SQL. [The Book of OHDSI Chapter 9] (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/SqlAndR.html) provides an overview of analysis of OHDSI data in R and SQL; note that you will not be able to avail yourselves of OHDSI software tools when analyzing your exported data for the reason explained above. &lt; ## Jupyter Notebooks and programming [Source:NIH All of US Study] (https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/360039690191-Jupyter-Notebooks-and-programming)</p>
<p>Below you will find links to helpful resources on using Jupyter Notebooks. Below you will find links to some of the most helpful resources that we have created and/or found on using Jupyter Notebooks.

<p>The <a href="https://data.ohdsi.org/QueryLibrary/">OMOP Query Library</a> is a library of commonly-used SQL queries for the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).</p>

<p>Below are some sample R queries that demonstrate how to read in OMOP tables from CSV files, join them based on the <code>person_id</code> and <code>visit_occurrence_id</code> fields, and search for specific criteria.</p>
<p>Note: Adjust the file paths and column names accordingly based on the actual structure and location of your CSV files. The queries below are a generic representation and may need adjustments based on the specifics of your data set.</p>

<p>Join tables based on <code>person_id</code>:</p>
<p>When a person has multiple visits in the <code>visit_occurrence</code> table, joining the <code>person</code> table with the <code>visit_occurrence</code> table will result in multiple rows for that person, each corresponding to a different visit. This is a standard one-to-many join operation.</p>
